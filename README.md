# Valkyrie

Valkyrie is a third-party service for the Roblox metagame, providing the features Roblox should have for gamers and games on Roblox. If you were looking for the legacy version of Valkyrie (As a development framework), this was moved to [Freya](https://github.com/CrescentCode/Freya).

## Features

Valkyrie provides the following features for games and players:

- Global bans
- Cross-game and out-of-game events
- Account aliasing
- Cross-game messaging
- Profile levels and achievements
- Join intents
- Extended game statistics
- Enhanced discovery and ranking algorithms
- Game reviews and weighted ratings
- Meta-game tracking
- Extended social/engagement APIs and statistics
- Game invites
- Game notifications
- In-game overlay

And more. It just gets messy at this point to list them all, but we promise that there's a lot of features to be had.

## Status

Valkyrie is currently **on hold** whilst designs for the website are worked out. If you'd like to contribute to Valkyrie and you have any design sense or Go programming knowledge, it would be much appreciated, and you can [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/bEuvcPF) to get in touch.

## Suggestions

Got any suggestions? Place an issue, and we'll be sure to take a look at it whenever we can. We're designing Valkyrie for the community that uses it, and we'd love to implement suggestions from the community that use it.
